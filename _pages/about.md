<br/>

I'm a master's student at <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/npark'>Big Data Analytics Lab</a>, Yonsei University. 
My research advisor is Prof. Noseong Park. 
My research interests include recommender systems, predictive modeling, and neural differential equations. 
I enjoy solving various real-world problems with data-driven deep learning algorithms.
Here is a full <a href='https://seoyoungh.github.io/files/CV_seoyoung.pdf'>Curriculum Vitae</a>.

When I’m not looking at code, I can usually be found travelling✈️, doing yoga🧘🏻‍♀️, doing workouts💪🏻, or watching films.
I desire to be someone who contributes to and changes the world. I want to live forever young, as my name says!
