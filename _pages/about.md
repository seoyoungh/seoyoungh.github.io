I'm a master student at <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/npark'>Big Data Analytics Lab</a>, Yonsei University. 
Research Advisor is <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/npark'>Prof. Noseong Park</a>. 
My research interests include `graph-based recommender systems`, `prediction-based optimization`, and `differential equations`. 
I enjoy solving various real-world problems with data-driven deep learning algorithms.
Here is a full <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1esb4iQXDwIbyni19VkZ1MOlOQxtGHcNg/view?usp=sharing'>Curriculum Vitae</a>.

When I’m not looking at code, I can usually be found travelling✈️, doing yoga🧘🏻‍♀️, doing workouts💪🏻, or watching films.
I desire to be someone who contributes to and changes the world. I want to live forever young, as my name says!
